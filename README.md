# IBM Cloud Event Streams Go SDK Version 1.3.1

## Introduction

IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud™ is a high-throughput message bus built with Apache Kafka. 
It is optimized for event ingestion into IBM Cloud and event stream distribution between your services and applications.

Event Streams provides a REST API to help connect your existing systems to your Event Streams Kafka cluster. 
Using the API, you can integrate Event Streams with any system that supports RESTful APIs.

Documentation [IBM Cloud Event Streams Service APIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/event-streams).

This is the Event Streams Software Development Kit for `Go`
It includes a library of functions used to access an Event Streams service instance.

# Event Streams Administration REST API

This REST API allows users of the
[IBM Event Streams service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/EventStreams/index.html)
to administer
[Kafka topics](#using-the-rest-api-to-administer-kafka-topics)
associated with an instance of the service. You can use this API to perform the following
operations:
  - [Create a Kafka topic](#creating-a-kafka-topic)
  - [List Kafka topics](#listing-kafka-topics)
  - [Get a Kafka topic](#getting-a-kafka-topic)
  - [Delete a Kafka topic](#deleting-a-kafka-topic)
  - [Update a Kafka topic configuration](#updating-kafka-topics-configuration)
  - [List which topics are mirrored](#list-current-mirroring-topic-selection)
  - [Replace selection of topics which are mirrored](#replace-selection-of-topics-which-are-mirrored)
  - [List active mirroring topics](#list-active-mirroring-topics)
  - [Create a Kafka quota](#creating-a-kafka-quota)
  - [List Kafka quotas](#listing-kafka-quotas)
  - [Get a Kafka quota](#getting-a-kafka-quota)
  - [Delete a Kafka quota](#deleting-a-kafka-quota)
  - [Update a Kafka quota information](#updating-kafka-quotas-information)
  
The Admin REST API is also [documented using swagger](./admin-rest-api.yaml).

## Access control
---

All requests support below authorization methods:
 * Basic authorization with user and password. (
  For both standard, enterprise and lite plans, user is 'token', password is the API key from `ibmcloud resource service-keys` for the service instance.)
 * Bearer authorization with bearer token. (This token can be either API key or JWT token obtained from IAM upon login to IBM Cloud. Use `ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens` to retrieve the token after `ibmcloud login`)
 * `X-Auth-Token` header to be set to the API key. This header is deprecated.

##  Administration API endpoint
---
Administration API endpoint is the `kafka_admin_url` property in the service key for the service instance. This command can be used to retrieve this property.
```bash
$ibmcloud resource service-key "${service_instance_key_name}" --output json > jq -r '.[]|.credentials.kafka_admin_url'
```

## Environment Setup
In the examples you must set and export environment variables as follows:
- Either the `API_KEY` or `BEARER_TOKEN` to use for authentication.
- `KAFKA_ADMIN_URL` to point to your Event Streams administration endpoint.

In addition, the `Content-type` header has to be set to `application/json`.

Common HTTP status codes:
- 200: Request succeeded.
- 202: Request was accepted.
- 400: Invalid request JSON.
- 401: The authentication header is not set or provided information is not valid.
- 403: Not authorized to perform the operation. Usually it means the API key used is missing a certain role. More details on what role can perform what operation refers to this [document](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-security).
- 404: Unable to find the topic with topic name given by user.
- 422: Semantically invalid request.
- 503: An error occurred handling the request.

Error responses carry a JSON body like the following:
```json
{"error_code":50301,"message":"Unknown Kafka Error", "incident_id": "17afe715-0ff5-4c49-9acc-a4204244a331"}
```
Error codes are of the format `HHHKK` where `HHH` is the HTTP Status Code and `KK` is the Kafka protocol error.  

For E2E debugging purposes, the transaction ID of every request is returned in the HTTP header `X-Global-Transaction-Id`.
If the header is set on the request, it will be honored. If not, it will be generated.
In the event of a non-200 error return code, the transaction ID is also returned in the JSON error response as `incident_id`.


## Using the REST API to administer Kafka topics
---

To run the example :-

Compile the code.
```sh
go build -o example
```
Or simply 
```sh
make build
```

Set the required environment variables
```sh
# Set your API KEY (or a bearer token could be used by setting the BEARER_TOKEN environment variable instead, but not both)
export API_KEY="abc123456789"

# Set the Admin Endpoint to point to your cluster.
export KAFKA_ADMIN_URL="https://xyzclustername.svc01.region.eventstreams.test.cloud.ibm.com"

```

Run the example
```sh
./example 
```

## REST API 
---
The following sections explain how the REST API works with examples.

### Code Setup

```golang
// Code Setup
import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os"

	"github.com/IBM/eventstreams-go-sdk/pkg/adminrestv1"
	"github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/v5/core"
)

// End Code Setup
```

### Authentication
---
Use one of the following methods to authenticate:

- To authenticate using Basic Auth:
  Place these values into the Authorization header of the HTTP request in the form Basic <credentials> 
  where <credentials> is the username and password joined by a single colon `:` base64 encoded. 
  For example:
  ```sh
  echo -n "token:<APIKEY>" | base64
  ```

- To authenticate using a bearer token:
  To obtain your token using the IBM Cloud CLI, first log in to IBM Cloud, then run the following command:
  ```
  ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
  ```
  Place this token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request in the form Bearer. Both API key or JWT tokens are supported.

- To authenticate directly using the api_key:
  Place the key directly as the value of the X-Auth-Token HTTP header.

#### Example

Here's an example of how to create the authenticator using either an API key or a BEARER_TOKEN

```golang
	// Create Authenticator
	var authenticator core.Authenticator

	if apiKey != "" {
		var err error
		// Create an Basic IAM authenticator.
		authenticator, err = core.NewBasicAuthenticator("token", apiKey)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("failed to create new basic authenticator: %s\n", err.Error())
			os.Exit(1)
		}
	} else {
		var err error
		// Create an IAM Bearer Token authenticator.
		authenticator, err = core.NewBearerTokenAuthenticator(bearerToken)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("failed to create new bearer token authenticator: %s\n", err.Error())
			os.Exit(1)
		}
	}
	// End Authenticator
```

### Creating a client for the Admin REST API.
---
Create a new service object.

```golang
	// Create Service
	serviceAPI, serviceErr := adminrestv1.NewAdminrestV1(&adminrestv1.AdminrestV1Options{
		URL:           URL,
		Authenticator: authenticator,
	})
	// End Create Service
```

### Creating a Kafka topic
---
To create a Kafka topic the admin REST SDK issues a POST request to the /admin/topics path. 
The body of the request contains a JSON document, for example:
```json
{
    "name": "topicname",
    "partitions": 1,
    "configs": {
        "retentionMs": 86400000,
        "cleanupPolicy": "delete"
    }
}
```

The only required field is name. The partitions fields defaults to 1 if not set.

Expected HTTP status codes:

- 202: Topic creation request was accepted.
- 400: Invalid request JSON.
- 403: Not authorized to create topic.
- 422: Semantically invalid request.

If the request to create a Kafka topic succeeds then HTTP status code 202 (Accepted) is returned. If the operation fails then a HTTP status code of 422 (Un-processable Entity) is returned, and a JSON object containing additional information about the failure is returned as the body of the response.




#### Example

```golang
func createTopic(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the createTopicOptionsModel.
	createTopicOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.CreateTopicOptions)
	createTopicOptionsModel.Name = core.StringPtr("test-topic")
	createTopicOptionsModel.PartitionCount = core.Int64Ptr(int64(1))

	// Create the Topic.
	response, operationErr := serviceAPI.CreateTopic(createTopicOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Creating Topics: %s\n", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result.
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusAccepted {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Creating Topic: status %d\n", response.StatusCode)
	}

	fmt.Printf("\tname: %s created\n", *createTopicOptionsModel.Name)

	return nil
} 
```


### Deleting a Kafka topic
---
To delete a Kafka topic, the admin REST SDK issues a DELETE request to the `/admin/topics/TOPICNAME`
path (where `TOPICNAME` is the name of the Kafka topic that you want to delete).

Expected return codes:
- 202: Topic deletion request was accepted.
- 403: Not authorized to delete topic.
- 404: Topic does not exist.
- 422: Semantically invalid request.
  
A 202 (Accepted) status code is returned if the REST API accepts the delete
request or status code 422 (Un-processable Entity) if the delete request is
rejected. If a delete request is rejected then the body of the HTTP response 
will contain a JSON object which provides additional information about why 
the request was rejected.

Kafka deletes topics asynchronously. Deleted topics may still appear in the
response to a [list topics request](#listing-kafka-topics) for a short period
of time after the completion of a REST request to delete the topic.

#### Example

```golang
func deleteTopic(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the DeleteTopicOptions model
	deleteTopicOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.DeleteTopicOptions)
	deleteTopicOptionsModel.TopicName = core.StringPtr("test-topic")

	// Delete Topic
	response, operationErr := serviceAPI.DeleteTopic(deleteTopicOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Deleting Topic: %s\n", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result.
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusAccepted {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Deleting Topic: status %d\n", response.StatusCode)
	}

	fmt.Printf("\tname: %s deleted\n", *deleteTopicOptionsModel.TopicName)
	return nil
} 
```

### Listing Kafka topics
---
You can list all of your Kafka topics by issuing a GET request to the
`/admin/topics` path. 

Expected status codes:
- 200: the topic list is returned as JSON in the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "topic1",
    "partitions": 1,
    "retentionMs": 86400000,
    "cleanupPolicy": "delete"
  },
  { "name": "topic2",
    "partitions": 2,
    "retentionMs": 86400000,
    "cleanupPolicy": "delete"
  }
]
```

A successful response will have HTTP status code 200 (OK) and contain an
array of JSON objects, where each object represents a Kafka topic and has the
following properties:

| Property name     | Description                                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| name              | The name of the Kafka topic.                            |
| partitions        | The number of partitions of the Kafka topic.            |
| retentionsMs      | The retention period for messages on the topic (in ms). |
| cleanupPolicy     | The cleanup policy of the Kafka topic.                  |

#### Example

```golang
func listTopics(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the ListTopicsOptions model
	listTopicsOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.ListTopicsOptions)

	// Call ListTopics.
	result, response, operationErr := serviceAPI.ListTopics(listTopicsOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Listing Topics" + operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result.
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Listing Topics: status %d\n", response.StatusCode)
	}

	// Loop and print topics.
	for _, topicDetail := range result {
		fmt.Printf("\tname: %s\n", *topicDetail.Name)
	}
	return nil
} 
```

### Getting a Kafka topic
---
To get a Kafka topic detail information, issue a GET request to the `/admin/topics/TOPICNAME`
path (where `TOPICNAME` is the name of the Kafka topic that you want to get).  

Expected status codes
- 200: Retrieve topic details successfully in following format:
```json
{
  "name": "MYTOPIC",
  "partitions": 1,
  "replicationFactor": 3,
  "retentionMs": 86400000,
  "cleanupPolicy": "delete",
  "configs": {
    "cleanup.policy": "delete",
    "min.insync.replicas": "2",
    "retention.bytes": "1073741824",
    "retention.ms": "86400000",
    "segment.bytes": "536870912"
  },
  "replicaAssignments": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "brokers": {
        "replicas": [
          3,
          2,
          4
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
- 403: Not authorized.
- 404: Topic does not exist.

#### Example

```golang
func topicDetails(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the GetTopicOptions model
	getTopicOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.GetTopicOptions)
	getTopicOptionsModel.TopicName = core.StringPtr("test-topic")

	// Call List Topic Details.
	result, response, operationErr := serviceAPI.GetTopic(getTopicOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Listing Topic Details" + operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result.
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Listing Topic Details: status %d\n", response.StatusCode)
	}

	// Print topics details.
	fmt.Printf("\tname: \t\t\t%s\n", *result.Name)

	// The number of partitions.
	fmt.Printf("\tno of partitions: \t%d\n", *result.Partitions)

	// The number of replication factor.
	fmt.Printf("\treplication factor: \t%d\n", *result.ReplicationFactor)

	// // The value of config property 'retention.ms'.
	fmt.Printf("\tretention (ms): \t%d\n", *result.RetentionMs)

	// // The value of config property 'cleanup.policy'.
	fmt.Printf("\tcleanup policy: \t%s\n", *result.CleanupPolicy)

	// Configs *TopicConfigs
	fmt.Printf("\ttopic configs: \t\t%+v\n", *result.Configs)

	// The replia assignment of the topic.
	// ReplicaAssignments []ReplicaAssignment
	for _, assignment := range result.ReplicaAssignments {
		fmt.Printf("\tassignment:  \t\tid:%d,  \tbrokers: %+v\n", assignment.ID, assignment.Brokers)
	}

	return nil

} 
```

### Updating Kafka topic's configuration
---
To increase a Kafka topic's partition number or to update a Kafka topic's configuration, issue a
`PATCH` request to `/admin/topics/TOPICNAME` with the following body:
(where TOPICNAME is the name of the Kafka topic that you want to update).
```json
{
  "new_total_partition_count": 4,
  "configs": [
    {
      "name": "cleanup.policy",
      "value": "compact"
    }
  ]
}
```
Supported configuration keys are 'cleanup.policy', 'retention.ms', 'retention.bytes', 'segment.bytes', 'segment.ms', 'segment.index.bytes'.
And partition number can only be increased, not decreased.

Expected status codes
- 202: Update topic request was accepted.
- 400: Invalid request JSON/number of partitions is invalid.
- 404: Topic specified does not exist.
- 422: Semantically invalid request.

#### Example

```golang
func updateTopicDetails(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the UpdateTopicOptions model
	updateTopicOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.UpdateTopicOptions)
	updateTopicOptionsModel.TopicName = core.StringPtr("test-topic")
	updateTopicOptionsModel.NewTotalPartitionCount = core.Int64Ptr(int64(6))

	// Invoke operation with valid options model.
	response, operationErr := serviceAPI.UpdateTopic(updateTopicOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Updating Topic: %s\n", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result.
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusAccepted {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Updating Topics: status %d\n", response.StatusCode)
	}

	fmt.Printf("\tname: %s updated\n", *updateTopicOptionsModel.TopicName)

	return nil
} 
```

### List current mirroring topic selection

Mirroring user controls are only available on the target cluster in a mirroring environment.

To get the current topic selection, issue an GET request to /admin/mirroring/topic-selection


Expected status codes
- 200: Retrieved topic selection successfully in following format:
```json
{
  "includes": [
    "^prefix1_.*",
    "^prefix2_.*"
  ]
}
```
- 403: Unauthorized to use mirroring user controls.
- 404: Mirroring not enabled. The mirroring user control APIs are only available on the target cluster of a mirrored pair.
- 503: An error occurred handling the request.

#### Example

```golang
func listMirroringTopicSelection(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the GetMirroringTopicSelectionOptions model
	getMirroringTopicSelectionOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.GetMirroringTopicSelectionOptions)

	// Call GetMirroringTopicSelection.
	result, response, operationErr := serviceAPI.GetMirroringTopicSelection(getMirroringTopicSelectionOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Listing Mirroring Topics: %s\n", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result.
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusAccepted {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Listing Mirroring Topics: status %d\n", response.StatusCode)
	}

	// Loop and print mirroring topics.
	for _, topicName := range result.Includes {
		fmt.Printf("\tname: %s\n", topicName)
	}

	return nil
} 
```

### Replace selection of topics which are mirrored

Replace mirroring topic selection

Mirroring user controls are available on the target cluster in a mirroring environment.

To replace the current topic selection, issue a POST request to /admin/mirroring/topic-selection

Expected status codes

- 200: Replaced topic selection successfully. The new selection is returned in following format:
```json
{
  "includes": [
    "^prefix1_.*",
    "^prefix2_.*"
  ]
}
```
- 400: Invalid request. The request data cannot be parsed and used to replace the topic selection.
- 403: Unauthorized to use mirroring user controls.
- 404: Mirroring not enabled. The mirroring user control APIs are only available on the target cluster of a mirrored pair.
- 415: Unsupported media type. Content-Type header with application/json is required.
- 503: An error occurred handling the request.

#### Example

```golang
func replaceMirroringTopicSelection(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the ReplaceMirroringTopicSelectionOptions model
	replaceMirroringTopicSelectionOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.ReplaceMirroringTopicSelectionOptions)
	replaceMirroringTopicSelectionOptionsModel.Includes = []string{"test-topic"}

	// Invoke operation with valid options model.
	result, response, operationErr := serviceAPI.ReplaceMirroringTopicSelection(replaceMirroringTopicSelectionOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Replacing Mirroring Topics: %s\n", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result.
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusAccepted {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Replacing Mirroring Topics: status %d\n", response.StatusCode)
	}

	// Loop and print mirroring topics.
	for _, topicName := range result.Includes {
		fmt.Printf("\ttopic added: %s\n", topicName)
	}

	return nil
} 
```

### List active mirroring topics
---
Mirroring user controls are available on the target cluster in a mirroring environment.

To get the list of currently mirrored topics, issue an GET request to /admin/mirroring/active-topics

Expected status codes

- 200: Retrieved active topics successfully in following format:
```json
{
  "active_topics": [
    "topic1",
    "topic2"
  ]
}
```
- 403: Unauthorized to use mirroring user controls.
- 404: Mirroring not enabled. The mirroring user control APIs are only available on the target cluster of a mirrored pair.
- 503: An error occurred handling the request.

#### Example

```golang
func getMirroringActiveTopics(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the GetMirroringActiveTopicsOptions model
	getMirroringActiveTopicsOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.GetMirroringActiveTopicsOptions)

	// Call GetMirroringActiveTopics.
	result, response, operationErr := serviceAPI.GetMirroringActiveTopics(getMirroringActiveTopicsOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Listing Active Mirroring Topics: %s\n", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result.
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusAccepted {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error Listing Active Mirroring Topics: status %d\n", response.StatusCode)
	}

	// Loop and print mirroring topics.
	for _, topicName := range result.ActiveTopics {
		fmt.Printf("\tname: %s\n", topicName)
	}

	return nil
} 
```


### Creating a Kafka quota
---
To create a Kafka quota the admin REST SDK issues a POST request to the /admin/quotas/ENTITYNAME path (where `ENTITYNAME` is the name of the entity that you want to create. The entity name of the quota can be `default` or an IAM Service ID that starts with an `iam-ServiceId` prefix).
The body of the request contains a JSON document, for example:
```json
{
    "producer_byte_rate": 1024,
    "consumer_byte_rate": 1024
}
```

Create Quota would create either 1 or 2 quotas depending on what data is passed in.

Expected HTTP status codes:

- 201: Quota creation request was created.
- 400: Invalid request JSON.
- 403: Not authorized to create quota.
- 422: Semantically invalid request.

If the request to create a Kafka quota succeeds then HTTP status code 201 (Created) is returned. If the operation fails then a HTTP status code of 422 (Un-processable Entity) is returned, and a JSON object containing additional information about the failure is returned as the body of the response.

#### Example

```golang
func createQuota(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the createQuotaOptionsModel
	createQuotaOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.CreateQuotaOptions)
	createQuotaOptionsModel.SetEntityName("iam-ServiceId-12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-1234567890af")
	createQuotaOptionsModel.SetProducerByteRate(1024)
	createQuotaOptionsModel.SetConsumerByteRate(1024)

	// Create Quota
	response, operationErr := serviceAPI.CreateQuota(createQuotaOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error creating quota: %s", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusCreated {
		return fmt.Errorf("error creating quota with status %d", response.StatusCode)
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n\tquota for the entity '%s' has been created", *createQuotaOptionsModel.EntityName)

	return nil
} 
```

### Deleting a Kafka quota
---
To delete a Kafka quota, the admin REST SDK issues a DELETE request to the `/admin/quotas/ENTITYNAME`
path (where `ENTITYNAME` is the name of the entity that you want to delete. The entity name of the quota can be `default` or an IAM Service ID that starts with an `iam-ServiceId` prefix).

Expected return codes:
- 202: Quota deletion request was accepted.
- 403: Not authorized to delete quota.
- 404: Entity Quota does not exist.
- 422: Semantically invalid request.

A 202 (Accepted) status code is returned if the REST API accepts the delete
request or status code 422 (Un-processable Entity) if the delete request is
rejected. If a delete request is rejected then the body of the HTTP response
will contain a JSON object which provides additional information about why
the request was rejected.


#### Example

```golang
func deleteQuota(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the DeleteQuotaOptions model
	deleteQuotaOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.DeleteQuotaOptions)
	deleteQuotaOptionsModel.EntityName = core.StringPtr("iam-ServiceId-12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-1234567890af")

	// Delete Quotas
	response, operationErr := serviceAPI.DeleteQuota(deleteQuotaOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error deleting quota: %s", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusAccepted {
		return fmt.Errorf("error deleting quota with status %d", response.StatusCode)
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n\tquota for the entity '%s' has been deleted", *deleteQuotaOptionsModel.EntityName)
	return nil
} 
```

### Listing Kafka quotas
---
You can list all of your Kafka quotas by issuing a GET request to the
`/admin/quotas` path.

Expected status codes:
- 200: quotas list is returned as JSON in the following format:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "entity_name": "default",
      "producer_byte_rate": 1024,
      "consumer_byte_rate": 1024
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "iam-ServiceId-38288dac-1f80-46dd-b135-a56153296bcd",
      "producer_byte_rate": 1024
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "iam-ServiceId-38288dac-1f80-46dd-b135-e56153296fgh",
      "consumer_byte_rate": 2048
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "iam-ServiceId-38288dac-1f80-46dd-b135-f56153296bfa",
      "producer_byte_rate": 2048,
      "consumer_byte_rate": 1024
    }
  ]
}
```

A successful response will have HTTP status code 200 (OK) and contain an
array of JSON objects, where each object represents a Kafka quota and has the
following properties:

| Property name     | Description                                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| entity_name       | The entity name of the quota can be `default` or an IAM Service ID that starts with an `iam-ServiceId` prefix.                           |
| producer_byte_rate| The producer byte rate quota value.            |
| consumer_byte_rate| The consumer byte rate quota value.            |


#### Example

```golang
func listQuotas(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the ListQuotasOptions model
	listQuotasOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.ListQuotasOptions)

	// Call ListQuotas
	result, response, operationErr := serviceAPI.ListQuotas(listQuotasOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error listing quotas: %s" + operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		return fmt.Errorf("error listing quotas with status %d", response.StatusCode)
	}

	// Loop and print quota
	for _, quota := range result.Data {
		fmt.Printf("\n\tentity_name: %s, %s", *quota.EntityName, prepareQuotaDetails(quota.ProducerByteRate, quota.ConsumerByteRate))
	}
	return nil
} 
```

### Getting a Kafka quota
---
To get a Kafka quota detail information, issue a GET request to the `/admin/quotas/ENTITYNAME`
path (where `ENTITYNAME` is the name of the entity that you want to get. The entity name of the quota can be `default` or an IAM Service ID that starts with an `iam-ServiceId` prefix).

Expected status codes
- 200: Retrieve quota details successfully in following format:
```json
{
  "producer_byte_rate": 1024,
  "consumer_byte_rate": 1024
}
```
- 403: Not authorized.

#### Example

```golang
func getQuota(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the GetQuotaOptions model
	getQuotaOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.GetQuotaOptions)
	getQuotaOptionsModel.EntityName = core.StringPtr("iam-ServiceId-12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-1234567890af")

	// Call Get Quota
	quota, response, operationErr := serviceAPI.GetQuota(getQuotaOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error getting quota: %s" + operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		return fmt.Errorf("error getting quota with status %d", response.StatusCode)
	}

	fmt.Print("\n\t" + prepareQuotaDetails(quota.ProducerByteRate, quota.ConsumerByteRate))
	return nil

} 
```

### Updating Kafka quota's information
---
To Update an entity's quota, issue a
`PATCH` request to `/admin/quotas/ENTITYNAME` with the following body:
(where `ENTITYNAME` is the name of the entity that you want to update. The entity name of the quota can be `default` or an IAM Service ID that starts with an `iam-ServiceId` prefix).
```json
{
  "producer_byte_rate": 2048,
  "consumer_byte_rate": 2048
}
```

Expected status codes
- 202: Update quota request was accepted.
- 400: Invalid request JSON.
- 404: Entity quota specified does not exist.
- 422: Semantically invalid request.


#### Example

```golang
func updateQuota(serviceAPI *adminrestv1.AdminrestV1) error {
	// Construct an instance of the updateQuotaOptionsModel
	updateQuotaOptionsModel := new(adminrestv1.UpdateQuotaOptions)
	updateQuotaOptionsModel.SetEntityName("iam-ServiceId-12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-1234567890af")
	updateQuotaOptionsModel.SetProducerByteRate(2048)
	updateQuotaOptionsModel.SetConsumerByteRate(2048)

	// Update Quota
	response, operationErr := serviceAPI.UpdateQuota(updateQuotaOptionsModel)
	if operationErr != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("error updating quota: %s", operationErr.Error())
	}

	// Check the result
	if response.StatusCode != http.StatusAccepted {
		return fmt.Errorf("error updating quota with status %d", response.StatusCode)
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n\tquota for the entity '%s' has been updated", *updateQuotaOptionsModel.EntityName)

	return nil
} 
```
