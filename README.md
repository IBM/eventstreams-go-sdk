# IBM Cloud Eventstreams Go SDK Version 1.1.0

## Introduction

IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloudâ„¢ is a high-throughput message bus built with Apache Kafka. 
It is optimized for event ingestion into IBM Cloud and event stream distribution between your services and applications.

Event Streams provides a REST API to help connect your existing systems to your Event Streams Kafka cluster. 
Using the API, you can integrate Event Streams with any system that supports RESTful APIs.

Documentation [IBM Cloud Eventstreams Service APIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/event-streams).

This is the Eventstreams Software Development Kit for `Go`
It includes a library of functions used to access a Eventstreams cluster.

## Overview

The IBM Cloud Eventstreams Go SDK allows developers to programmatically interact with the following IBM Cloud services:

Service Name | Package name 
--- | --- 
[Admin Rest](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/event-streams) | pkg/adminrestv1
[Schema Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-ES_schema_registry&locale=en#schema_registry_rest_endpoints) | pkg/schemaregistryv1

## Prerequisites

* An [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) account.
* The [IBM Cloud CLI.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started)
* An IAM API key to allow the SDK to access your account. Create one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
* A IBM Cloud Eventstreams Instance Create one [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration?target=/catalog/services/event-streams)
* Go version 1.14 or above.

## Installation
The current version of this SDK: 1.1.0

There are a few different ways to download and install the Eventstreams Go SDK project for use by your
Go application:

#### `go get` command  
Use this command to download and install the SDK to allow your Go application to
use it:

```
go get -u github.ibm.com/IBM/eventstreams-go-sdk 
```

#### Go modules  
If your application is using Go modules, you can add a suitable import to your
Go application, like this:

```go
import (
	"github.ibm.com/IBM/eventstreams-go-sdk/pkg/adminrestv1"
)
```

then run `go mod tidy` to download and install the new dependency and update your Go application's
`go.mod` file.

#### `dep` dependency manager  
If your application is using the `dep` dependency management tool, you can add a dependency
to your `Gopkg.toml` file.  Here is an example:

```
[[constraint]]
  name = "github.ibm.com/IBM/eventstreams-go-sdk"
  version = "1.1.0"

```

then run `dep ensure`.
